Model Selection by Cross-Validation
-----------------------------------

```{r}
library(ISLR)
library(MASS)

set.seed(11)
Hitters <- na.omit(Hitters)

folds <- sample(rep(1:10, length = nrow(Hitters))) #assign numbers 1:10 and randomize it

table(folds) #the folds are balanced
cv.errors <- matrix(NA,10,19) #10row and 19 col
```

To refer :- 
```{r}
predict.regsubsets = function(object, newdata, id, ...) {
    form = as.formula(object$call[[2]])
    mat = model.matrix(form, newdata)
    coefi = coef(object, id = id)
    mat[, names(coefi)] %*% coefi
}
```


```{r}
for (k in 1:10) {
    best.fit = regsubsets(Salary ~ ., data = Hitters[folds != k, ], nvmax = 19, 
        method = "forward")
    for (i in 1:19) {
        pred = predict(best.fit, Hitters[folds == k, ], id = i)
        cv.errors[k, i] = mean((Hitters$Salary[folds == k] - pred)^2)
    }
}

rmse.cv <- sqrt(apply(cv.errors,2,mean))
plot(rmse.cv, pch = 19, type = "b")
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
